# 12-Factor Agents Demo

This repository contains demo code and resources for the 12-Factor Agents methodology, a framework for building production-grade AI systems. It accompanies our YouTube series exploring each factor in detail.

## What is 12-Factor Agents?

The [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) methodology, created by Dex at Human Layer, provides architectural patterns for building reliable, secure, and scalable AI systems. Inspired by the original [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology, it addresses the fundamental challenges of moving AI systems from impressive demos to robust production deployments.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by factors, with each directory containing:
- Example implementations demonstrating the factor
- Documentation and explanation
- Resources for the corresponding YouTube video

Currently implemented factors:

- **Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls** - Converting natural language requests into structured tool calls, the foundation of any AI agent system. See the [factor-specific README](factor-01/README.md) for details.
