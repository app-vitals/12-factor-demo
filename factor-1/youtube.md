# Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls

## Hook
* If you're building AI systems and want them to work reliably in production rather than just demos, this video is for you.

## 12 Factor Agents
GOTO https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents
* The 12 Factor Agents methodology is a set of best practices for building production-grade AI systems.
GOTO https://12factor.net/
* It draws from the 12 Factor App methodology for building web applications.

In this video, going to show you how to build a custom AI WhatsApp bot with Python. If you don’t know who I am, my name is Dave Ebbelaar and I'm the founder of Datalumina. I've been building custom data and AI solutions for the past 5 years and create educational videos like this to help you do the same and ultimately start freelancing.

In this video we'll show you how to implement Factor 1 of the 12-Factor Agents methodology. if you don't know who we are, I'm Dan Mcaulay (AI Engineer) and this is Dave O'Dell (DevOps Engineer), we've both been building software for over 20 years.

Factor 1 is the process of transforming natural language to tool calls. Our example uses cloud infrastructure, but the patterns we demonstrate apply to any AI agent you're building.

We'll start with an example that generates shell commands.

...

Next we'll show you how to use tools to build commands for creating AWS and GCP buckets.

...

Finally, we'll show you how to leverage tools to orchestrate a workflow that allows an agent to validate and create buckets in AWS.

...

Conclusion
In this video we started with a basic prompt that generates shell commands, then we moved on to using tools to build commands for creating AWS and GCP buckets. Finally, we showed you how to leverage tools to orchestrate a workflow that allows an agent to validate and create buckets in AWS.

So that's it for this video.
